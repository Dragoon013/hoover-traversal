This is the readme

Built using node v6.10.3

## Node Installation
Please review the node downloads for your operating system: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
If using OSX and you have Homebrew installed, use: brew install node

You can run the program with the test  file via this command:
node server test*.txt

Feel free to add additional test*.txt files, and the program will run them in sequence. Expect to see the output on the command line, not in the browser.
